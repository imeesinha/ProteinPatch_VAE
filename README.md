# ProteinPatch_VAE
Protein patch variational autoencoder (VAE) to characterize protein surface topography &amp; chemistry

This project is designed for the creation of latent salient features for inhomogeneous protein surface patches using a 3D convolutional variational autoencoder. 
The project has three components:
1. Creation of patch voxels from raw protein PDB files 
2. Training of a 3D Convolutional VAE using patch voxel dataset, and subsequent creation of patch latent vectors 
3. Training of a property prediction 3D Conv VAE for patch dataset
